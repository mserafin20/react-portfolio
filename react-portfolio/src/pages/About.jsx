                    My name is Michael Serafin and I'm in the process of learning to become a full-stack web developer at the UPenn LPS Bootcamp! Some hobbies outside of this one include going to the gym, playing video games, and going on long hikes!

                    I'm currently working as an Acillary Warehouse Specialist at a company called Quip Laboratories, which is a chemical manuafactuing company that specializes in cleaning chemicals and disenfectants. I've been working there for about 4 years now and I'm looking to make a career change into the tech industry.

                    I'm currently learning how to use React, Node.js, and Express.js. I'm also learning how to use MongoDB and MySQL. I'm excited to learn more about these technologies and how to use them to create full-stack web applications!
